# Minecraft Crowd Control

Minecraft Crowd Control is a plugin for [Paper](https://papermc.io/) 1.17.1 and 1.18 that allows
your Twitch community to interact with your game.

This version of the plugin is to be used with [crowdcontrol.live](https://crowdcontrol.live) which
allows viewers to control your game via bits or channel points.

Commands are fully compatible with multiplayer servers. Players on the server will be able to
receive effects targeted at them using **/account link <username>**.

## Installation

Installation steps differ depending on the Minecraft version you wish to use, whether you want to
use Forge mods, and the type of installation you wish to perform. Most casual users of the software
will be interested in the guides listed in the rightmost column (automatic local server setup).
