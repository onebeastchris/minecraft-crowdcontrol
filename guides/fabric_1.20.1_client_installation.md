## Fabric 1.20.1 Client Installation

### Installing the Mod

The following steps detail how to install the Crowd Control mod in the vanilla Minecraft launcher.
Users of other launchers should find and download the mod from Modrinth or CurseForge.

1. Download and run the [Fabric Loader installer](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/).
    - You may first need to download and install [Java](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/).
2. Ensure the Minecraft version is set to 1.20.1 and click the `Install` button.
3. Navigate to your Minecraft installation folder.
    - On Windows, this can be accessed by Pressing `Windows Key + R` and typing
      `%AppData%\.minecraft`.
4. Create a new folder called `mods`.
5. Download the latest build of the
   [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api/versions?g=1.20.1&c=release)
   and place it in the `mods` folder.
6. Download the latest build of
   [Crowd Control for Fabric](https://modrinth.com/mod/crowdcontrol/versions?l=fabric&g=1.20.1)
   and place it in the `mods` folder.
7. (Optional) Copy all the other Fabric 1.20.1 mods that you want to play with into the `mods`
   folder.

You may now [join a Crowd Control server](fabric_joining_a_server.md) or
[start a single player session](#starting-a-single-player-session).
