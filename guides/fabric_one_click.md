2. In the Game Selection tab, select **Minecraft (Fabric) (PC)**.
3. Click **One Click Setup** to automatically set up a Crowd Control profile in your Minecraft
   launcher.
4. Once setup is done, you can click the **Open Profile Folder** button and copy any Fabric 1.19.4
   mods you want to play with into the `mods` folder.
5. Open the Minecraft Launcher, select the `fabric-loader` profile, press Play, and open a
   singleplayer world.
6. Run the command `/account link <your twitch username>` to ensure you receive effects that viewers
