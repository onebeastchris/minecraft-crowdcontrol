## Paper: Streamer Setup (External Server)

The following steps are for streamers who are connecting to another individual's server.

1. Download and install the [Crowd Control PC app](https://crowdcontrol.live/setup).
2. In the **Game Selection** tab, select **Minecraft (Paper Server) (PC)**.
3. Click **Start**. A pop-up menu will appear prompting you for information that you should have
   received from your server administrator.
    - In the host field, you should enter an IP address or a website URL. This will usually be the
      same as the IP address that you connect to in Minecraft.
    - In the password field, you must enter a secret passphrase provided to you by the server
      administrator.
4. Upon joining the Minecraft server, run the command `/account link <your twitch username>` to
   ensure you receive effects that viewers purchase for you. Example: `/account link jaku`
