## Paper: Automatic Local Server

The following steps provide a quick setup for running a local game server on Minecraft 1.19.3.

1. Download and install the [Crowd Control PC app](https://crowdcontrol.live/setup).
2. In the Game Selection tab, select **Minecraft (Paper Server) (PC)**.
3. Click **One Click Server Setup** to automatically set up a server. This may take several minutes
   to complete. Make sure to accept any prompts to install software (namely the Java runtime
   environment).
4. Once setup is done, click **Launch Server** to start the Minecraft server.
5. Once the Minecraft server has started, click **Start** in the Crowd Control app to connect to the
   server. Enter in `localhost` as the host and `crowdcontrol` as the password.
6. Open your Minecraft launcher and press **Play** on a profile using Java Edition 1.19.3.
   To create a new profile:
   1. Click the **Installations** tab.
   2. Click **New installation**.
   3. Enter a name for the profile (e.g. Crowd Control).
   4. Under the **Version** dropdown, select **release 1.19.3**.
   5. Click **Create**.
7. Open the Multiplayer menu, use the **Add Server** button with the IP `localhost` if you haven't
   already, and connect to the server.
8. In Minecraft, run the command `/account link <your twitch username>` to ensure you receive
   effects that viewers purchase for you. Example: `/account link jaku`
