## Paper: Streamer Setup (Automatic Local Server)

The following steps are for streamers who are playing alone.

1. Download and install the [Crowd Control PC app](https://crowdcontrol.live/setup).
2. In the Game Selection tab, select **Minecraft (Paper Server) (PC)**.
3. Click **One Click Server Setup** to automatically set up a server. This may take several minutes
   to complete. Make sure to accept any prompts to install software (namely the Java runtime
   environment).
4. Once setup is done, click **Launch Server** to start the Minecraft server. You may optionally
   run `/password <password>` to change the password required to connect to the server. By default,
   the password is set to `crowdcontrol`.
6. Once the Minecraft server has started, click **Start** in the Crowd Control app to connect to the
   server. Enter in `localhost` as the host and the password you set (or `crowdcontrol` by default).
7. Upon joining the Minecraft server, run the command `/account link <your twitch username>` to
   ensure you receive effects that viewers purchase for you. Example: `/account link jaku`
