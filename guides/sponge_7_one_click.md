## Sponge 7: Automatic Local Server

The following steps provide a quick setup for running a local game server on Forge 1.12.2.

1. Download and install the [Crowd Control PC app](https://crowdcontrol.live/setup).
2. In the Game Selection tab, select **Minecraft (Sponge) 1.12.2 (PC)**.
3. Click **One Click Server Setup** to automatically set up a server. This may take several minutes
   to complete. Make sure to accept any prompts to install software (namely the Java runtime
   environment).
4. Once setup is done, you can click the **Open Server Folder** button and copy any
   Forge 1.12.2 mods or Sponge 7 plugins you want to play with into the `mods` folder.
   When playing a modpack, you may also have to copy the `config` folder as well.
5. Click **Launch Server** to start the Minecraft server.
6. Once the Minecraft server has started, click **Start** in the Crowd Control app to connect to the
   server. Enter in `localhost` as the host and `crowdcontrol` as the password.
7. Open your Minecraft: Java Edition launcher (vanilla or custom is ok), select your 1.12.2-based
   profile/modpack, and press **Play**.
8. Open the Multiplayer menu, use the **Add Server** button with the IP `localhost` if you haven't
   already, and connect to the server.
9. In Minecraft, run the command `/account link <your twitch username>` to ensure you receive
   effects that viewers purchase for you. Example: `/account link jaku`
